## Installation

## Requirements
* python (>3.8)
* networkx
* numpy             
* random            
* scipy             
* matplotlib        


## Datasets

In our paper, the DC algorithm is tested on networks (e.g., Email, Wiki, Hamsterster, Polblogs, etc.).


## Usage

If you want to use this algorithm for your data, you should format it as a graph type **G** with Networkx in Python, then use the following file:


## Find the smallest cycles:
SmallestCycles.py

## DC algorithm: DC=a*degree+(1-a)*cycles_ratio
DC_function.py

## Robust test:
Robustness.py

## SIR epidemic transmission test:
SIR.py


## SIS targeted immunization test:
SIS.py
